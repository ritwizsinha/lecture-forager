## Good to have features:
1. Integration with other services like teams, google meet, webex to directly stream the current video for transcribing.
2. Partition the available video into chunks according to topics being discussed
3. Finding out keywords from the transcription and removing ordinary and common words (a developer side thing but might improve search results)
4. Adding subtitles to the video
5. Summarizing a particular chunk of transcription to create sort of notes. (text summarization)
